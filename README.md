# Mentoring project from Data Science Academy

The main goal of this project, suggested in my mentorship at Data Science Academy, is to take part on the Kaggle competition:

The main ideia is to lead 6 mentored that will colaborate in order to learn from basics to advanced techniques in Data Science and Analytics.

Later, after Kaggle submition, we intend to use IBM Watson and other tools to deploy our Machine Learning model.
